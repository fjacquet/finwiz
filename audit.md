# FinWiz Agent Configuration Audit

After reviewing all crew configurations, here's my assessment of agent tools, memory usage, and LLM model optimization:

## 1. Tool Usage Analysis

### Current Tool Configuration
All crews use the same set of tools:

- DirectorySearchTool (local files)
- SerperDevTool (search and news)
- FirecrawlScrapeWebsiteTool (web scraping)
- FirecrawlSearchTool (web search)
- YoutubeVideoSearchTool (video research)

### Recommendations

**Add Financial Data Tools**: Each crew would benefit from domain-specific financial data APIs:
- Stock Crew: Add Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage API tools for real-time stock data ✅
- ETF Crew: Add ETF-specific data sources like ETFdb API integration ✅
- Crypto Crew: Add CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap API tools for cryptocurrency data ✅
- Report Crew: Add visualization tools for portfolio allocation charts

**Tool Specialization by Agent Type**:
- Analysts should have more data-focused tools
- Risk managers need risk assessment tools
- Research directors need synthesis and knowledge management tools

## 2. Memory Usage Assessment

### Current Memory Configuration
All crews have `memory=True` and `cache=True` which is good for continuity.

### Recommendations
- **Long-term Memory Storage**: Implement a more persistent storage mechanism to retain insights across multiple runs
- **Cross-Crew Memory Sharing**: Enable memory sharing between crews for better integration (especially for Report Crew)
- **Memory Retrieval Mechanisms**: Add explicit memory retrieval calls in task descriptions to ensure agents use past insights

## 3. LLM Model Optimization

### Current Configuration
- All crews use "gpt-4.1-mini" for the manager_llm
- All agents use the same model (specified in config files)
- All have max_reasoning_steps=3

### Recommendations

**Tiered Model Approach**:
- Research Director: Upgrade to gpt-4o or gpt-4-turbo for complex reasoning and synthesis ✅
- Technical/Risk Analysts: Continue with current models as they're adequate ✅
- Market Analysts: Consider using gpt-4.1-mini as it's sufficient for market trend analysis
- Report Crew Integration Analyst: Upgrade to gpt-4o for better multi-asset class integration ✅

**Reasoning Steps Adjustment**:
- Increase max_reasoning_steps to 5 for Research Directors and Risk Managers ✅
- Keep max_reasoning_steps at 3 for other analysts ✅

## 4. Process Flow Optimization

### Current Configuration
All crews have:

- process=Process.parallel (recently changed from sequential)
- allow_delegation=True
- respect_context_window=True
- max_retries=10

### Recommendations

**Process Type**:
- Consider hybrid approach using Process.hierarchical with Research Director as overseer
- Keep parallel processing for independent tasks but allow hierarchical oversight

**Task Assignment**:
- Add explicit agent assignments to tasks where missing ✅
- Ensure delegation options are clearly defined in task contexts

## 5. Consistency Issues
- Stock Crew: Specifies agent in research_synthesis_task but other crews don't
- ETF Crew: Missing agent specifications in tasks
- Report Crew: Using Process.parallel despite sequential nature described in docstrings

## Implementation Priority
1. Implement financial domain-specific tools for each crew ✅
2. Upgrade LLM models for Research Directors and Report Crew Integration Analyst ✅
3. Standardize task agent assignments across all crews ✅
4. Review and potentially revert Report Crew to sequential processing ✅
5. Enhance memory mechanisms for cross-crew knowledge sharing

> Would you like me to implement any of these recommendations, or would you prefer to focus on a specific aspect first?
