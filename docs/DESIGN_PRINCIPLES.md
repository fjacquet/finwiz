# FinWiz Design Principles

## Overview

FinWiz is designed to be elegant and minimalist, like a haiku.
It works with crewai as a flow of tasks and as the fondation of all.
This document outlines the core principles that guide its development.

## Core Principles

### Simple and Easy to Understand

- Code should be self-explanatory
- Functions should have a single responsibility
- Class and function names should clearly describe their purpose
- Comments and docstrings should explain "why" not just "what"

### Light as a Haiku

Like a haiku poem with its strict form of simplicity and elegance:

- Minimal dependencies
- Concise implementations
- Elegant solutions over complex ones
- Purposeful design choices

### CrewAI Flow Design Principles

- Clear separation between state and behavior
- Explicit flow transitions
- Parallel processing where appropriate
- Event-driven architecture

### Configuration-Driven Design

- Separate code from configuration using YAML files
- Use CrewAI decorators (@agent, @task, @crew) with config dictionaries
- Maintain strict separation between agent/task definitions and their parameters
- Configuration should be externally modifiable without code changes
- Default to configuration-driven approach, with coded fallbacks for robustness

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Avoid premature optimization
- Choose straightforward solutions over clever ones
- Minimize complexity in algorithms and structures
- Favor readability over brevity

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Only implement features that are immediately necessary
- Avoid speculative generality
- Refactor when patterns emerge, not before
- Focus on solving the current problem well

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Extract common functionality into helper methods
- Use inheritance and composition appropriately
- Maintain a single source of truth for data
- Leverage patterns like the template method when appropriate

## Code Structure Guidelines

1. **State Management**
   - Keep state immutable where possible
   - Document state transitions clearly
   - Minimize global state

2. **Flow Design**
   - Use descriptive names for flow steps
   - Document dependencies between steps
   - Keep flows linear where possible

3. **Error Handling**
   - Fail fast and explicitly
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

4. **Documentation**
   - Document public interfaces thoroughly
   - Include examples where appropriate
   - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

5. **Module Organization**
   - Split utility functions into separate modules by functionality
   - Use empty `__init__.py` files for package structure
   - Prefer explicit imports from specific modules over package-level imports
   - Place all imports at the top of the file, never inline within functions or methods
   - Group related functionality in dedicated directories

6. **Project Directory Layout**
   - The `src` directory should contain only Python source code (e.g., the main application package `finwiz`, tools, etc.).
   - Data files, logs, outputs, archives, and other runtime artifacts should be stored in directories at the project root (e.g., `knowledge/`, `logs/`, `output/`, `archive/`, `storage/`).
   - Configuration in `settings.py` should define the paths to these root-level artifact directories. This keeps the source code separate from generated data and improves clarity.

7. **Python Package and Workflow Management**
   - Use `uv` for all Python package and virtual environment operations (e.g., `uv pip install`, `uv venv`).
   - Run individual Python scripts using `uv run python <script.py>`.
   - To execute the main project workflow, use the `crewai flow kickoff` command from the project root. This is the standard way to run the entire sequence of crews.

     ```bash
     crewai flow kickoff
     ```

   - Maintain consistent package versions across development environments.

8. **Report Generation**
   - Generate reports in HTML format for rich presentation
   - Always include UTF-8 encoding declarations to handle special characters and emojis
   - Use emojis strategically to enhance readability and visual appeal
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility with proper HTML5 standards
   - Structure reports with clear sections and a logical flow of information

## Implementation Examples

### Good Example - DRY Principle

```python
# Instead of repeating file processing logic:
def _process_files(self, file_list: List[str], file_type: str) -> None:
    """Process files of a specific type."""
    print(f"Indexing {file_type}")
    for file in file_list:
        print(Path(file).name)
        archive_files(file)

# Then use it in specific handlers:
def index_text(self):
    self._process_files(self.state.document_state.list_txt, "text")
```

### Good Example - KISS Principle

```python
# Simple, direct approach to file archiving
def archive_files(file: str) -> None:
    """Move processed files to an archive directory."""
    knowledge_dir = "knowledge"
    archive_dir = "archive"
    
    if not os.path.exists(knowledge_dir):
        return
        
    rel_path = os.path.relpath(file, knowledge_dir)
    dest_dir = os.path.join(archive_dir, os.path.dirname(rel_path))
    os.makedirs(dest_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    dest_file = os.path.join(archive_dir, rel_path)
    shutil.move(file, dest_file)
```

### Good Example - Module Organization with Tool Factories

This project organizes tools by domain and uses factory functions to provide them to the crews. This keeps the crew definitions clean and separates tool implementation from tool consumption.

```text
src/finwiz/tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ finance_tools.py          # Factory functions for finance tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web_tools.py              # Factory functions for web/search tools
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yahoo_finance_tool.py     # Implementation of all Yahoo Finance tools
```

```python
# In a crew file (e.g., src/finwiz/crews/stock_crew/stock_crew.py)

# Import the factory function, not the individual tools
from finwiz.tools.finance_tools import get_stock_research_tools
from finwiz.tools.web_tools import get_search_tools, get_scrape_tools

# The crew can then easily be equipped with a curated set of tools
class StockCrew:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = [
            *get_search_tools(),
            *get_scrape_tools(),
            *get_stock_research_tools(),
        ]
        # ... setup agents and tasks with these tools
```

### Good Example - KISS and "Light as a Haiku" with Cohesive Tool Modules

Instead of splitting every single tool into its own file, related tools are grouped into a single, cohesive module. This reduces file clutter while still maintaining a clear separation of concerns.

```text
# src/finwiz/tools/yahoo_finance_tool.py

# All related Yahoo Finance tools are in one file
class YahooFinanceTickerInfoTool(BaseTool):
    # ... implementation

class YahooFinanceHistoryTool(BaseTool):
    # ... implementation

class YahooFinanceCompanyInfoTool(BaseTool):
    # ... implementation

# ... and so on.
```

This approach provides a clean, organized, and easy-to-maintain structure for managing the project's tools.
```

### Good Example - HTML Report Generation with Emojis

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

            max-width: 1200px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            padding: 20px;
        }
        h1 {

            border-bottom: 2px solid #3498db;
            padding-bottom: 10px;
        }
        .emoji-header {

            margin-right: 10px;
        }
        .key-point {

            padding: 10px 15px;
            margin: 15px 0;
        }
        .toc {
            background-color: #f8f9fa;
            padding: 15px;
            border-radius: 5px;
            margin-bottom: 20px;
        }
    </style>
