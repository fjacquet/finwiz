# FinWiz Technical Reference

This document provides a technical reference for the FinWiz project, covering its architecture, components, and advanced features.

## Project Architecture

FinWiz is built on the [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) framework and follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility and maintainability.

- **Crews**: The core of the application. Each crew is a specialized team of AI agents designed to perform a specific type of financial analysis (e.g., Crypto, Stocks, ETFs).
- **Agents**: The individual AI workers within a crew. Each agent has a specific role, goal, and set of tools. Agent configurations are defined in `agents.yaml` files.
- **Tasks**: The specific assignments for agents. Tasks define the work to be done, the expected output, and which agent should perform it. Task configurations are defined in `tasks.yaml` files.
- **Tools**: The functions and APIs that agents can use to perform their tasks. This includes web search tools, data scraping tools, and financial data APIs.
- **Flow**: The `crewai.flow` orchestrates the execution of the different crews in a predefined sequence.

## Crews

FinWiz includes the following pre-configured crews:

### 1. Crypto Crew

- **Objective**: To analyze the cryptocurrency market.
- **Tasks**: Performs technical analysis, risk assessment, and develops investment strategies for specified cryptocurrencies.
- **Output**: A detailed report on the analyzed digital asset.

### 2. Stock Crew

- **Objective**: To research and analyze publicly traded stocks.
- **Tasks**: Conducts market analysis, screens stocks based on predefined criteria, performs technical analysis, and assesses risk.
- **Output**: A report on promising stock investment opportunities.

### 3. ETF Crew

- **Objective**: To analyze Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).
- **Tasks**: Analyzes market trends, screens for suitable ETFs, and assesses risk factors.
- **Output**: A report with investment strategies for ETFs.

## Customization

You can easily customize FinWiz by modifying the YAML configuration files located in each crew's directory (`src/finwiz/crews/<crew_name>/config/`).

- **To modify an agent**: Edit the `agents.yaml` file. You can change an agent's `role`, `goal`, `backstory`, or assigned `tools`.
- **To modify a task**: Edit the `tasks.yaml` file. You can change a task's `description`, `expected_output`, or the `agent` assigned to it.

## Asynchronous Task Execution

To enhance performance, FinWiz utilizes asynchronous execution for I/O-bound tasks, such as calling external APIs or scraping websites.

### How it Works

Tasks that can run concurrently without waiting for each other are marked with `async_execution=True` in their respective crew definition files (e.g., `src/finwiz/crews/stock_crew/stock_crew.py`). This allows CrewAI to run these tasks in parallel, significantly reducing the total execution time.

### Important Constraint

When using a `Process.sequential` workflow in CrewAI, there is a key limitation:

> **The final task in a sequential crew must be synchronous.**

This means the last task in the sequence cannot have `async_execution=True`. All preceding tasks can be asynchronous. FinWiz's crews are configured to adhere to this rule to ensure the workflow runs correctly. If you modify the task sequence or add new tasks, ensure the final task remains synchronous.

## Available Tools

The agents in FinWiz are equipped with a variety of tools to perform their research, including:

- `SerperDevTool`: For general web searches.
- `FirecrawlScrapeWebsiteTool`: For scraping content from websites.
- `FirecrawlSearchTool`: For searching within a website's content.
- `YoutubeVideoSearchTool`: For finding relevant videos on YouTube.
- `YahooFinanceNewsTool`: For fetching financial news.
- And other specialized financial data tools.
