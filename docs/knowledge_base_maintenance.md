# FinWiz Knowledge Base Maintenance Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for maintaining the FinWiz RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) knowledge base to ensure it remains accurate, relevant, and performant over time.

## Maintenance Schedule

| Frequency | Action | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Daily | Automated Updates | Run `update_knowledge_base.py` to refresh market data for tracked assets |
| Weekly | Quality Review | Sample and review knowledge entries for accuracy and relevance |
| Monthly | Pruning | Remove outdated information (older than 30 days) unless marked as evergreen |
| Quarterly | Collection Optimization | Reindex collections and optimize vector embeddings |

## Data Lifecycle Management

### Data Entry Guidelines

1. **Structured Format**
   - All entries should include: asset identifier, timestamp, source, and confidence level
   - Financial metrics should use consistent units and notation

2. **Categorization**
   - Tag entries with appropriate metadata: asset class, analysis type, timeframe
   - Use consistent terminology across all entries

3. **Versioning**
   - For fundamental analysis, include version numbers
   - Link related entries to show progression of analysis

### Data Retention Policy

| Data Type | Retention Period | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Market Data | 30 days | Price, volume, technical indicators |
| Fundamental Analysis | 90 days | Financial statements, ratios |
| Research Reports | 180 days | Full analysis documents |
| Evergreen Content | Indefinite | Core concepts, methodologies |

## Performance Optimization

### Vector Database Management

1. **Regular Reindexing**
   - Schedule monthly reindexing of vector collections
   - Monitor query performance and reindex more frequently if degradation occurs

2. **Chunking Strategy**
   - Financial reports: 400 token chunks with 100 token overlap
   - Market data: 200 token chunks with 50 token overlap

3. **Embedding Models**
   - Review embedding model performance quarterly
   - Consider fine-tuning for financial domain-specific terminology

### Query Optimization

1. **Prompt Templates**
   - Maintain standardized query templates for common financial questions
   - Optimize retrieval prompts for different asset classes

2. **Result Filtering**
   - Implement recency bias for time-sensitive data
   - Apply relevance thresholds to filter low-quality matches

## Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate (First Month)**
   - Set up daily automated updates via cron job
   - Implement basic pruning of outdated entries

2. **Short-term (1-3 Months)**
   - Develop quality metrics for knowledge entries
   - Create dashboard for monitoring knowledge base health

3. **Medium-term (3-6 Months)**
   - Implement advanced filtering and metadata management
   - Develop specialized embeddings for financial content

4. **Long-term (6+ Months)**
   - Explore cross-collection retrieval strategies
   - Implement automated quality assessment
