# FinWiz: AI-Powered Financial Research Crews

**FinWiz** is a sophisticated financial analysis platform powered by autonomous AI agents built with the [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai) framework. It leverages specialized crews of AI agents to perform in-depth research and generate comprehensive reports on various financial instruments, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and ETFs.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Specialized Research Crews**: Dedicated crews for Crypto, Stocks, and ETFs, each with tailored agents and tasks.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Agents and tasks are configured via YAML files, allowing for easy customization and extension.
- **Asynchronous Task Execution**: Leverages async operations to significantly speed up I/O-bound tasks like web scraping and API calls, improving overall performance.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Utilizes a local knowledge base (RAG) to store and retrieve information, ensuring consistency and reducing redundant research.
- **Structured Output**: Generates detailed reports in Markdown and other formats, ready for review.
- **Modular and Extendable**: The project is structured to be easily extendable with new crews, agents, or tools.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to keep the codebase organized and maintainable:

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run FinWiz on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A Python package manager like `pip` with `uv`.
- API keys for any services you wish to use (e.g., Serper, Firecrawl).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd finwiz
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   - If an `.env.example` file exists, copy it to `.env`:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Open the `.env` file and add your API keys.

3. **Install dependencies:**

   The project uses `uv` for dependency management.

   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt # Or use your preferred package manager
   ```

### Running the Flow

To kick off the entire financial analysis workflow, run the main flow:

```bash
crewai flow kickoff
```

This command will execute the predefined sequence of crews (Crypto, Stock, ETF) and generate the final reports in the `output/` directory.

## ðŸ¤– Crews Overview

FinWiz is composed of several specialized crews:

- **Crypto Crew**: Analyzes the cryptocurrency market, focusing on technical analysis, risk assessment, and investment strategies for specific digital assets.
- **Stock Crew**: Conducts research on publicly traded stocks, performing technical analysis, screening, and risk assessment to identify promising investment opportunities.
- **ETF Crew**: Specializes in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), analyzing market trends, screening for suitable funds, and assessing risk to provide investment strategies.

## âš¡ Performance Enhancements

### Asynchronous Execution

To improve performance, FinWiz leverages asynchronous task execution for I/O-bound operations. Tasks that involve fetching data from the web or calling external APIs are marked with `async_execution=True`.

**Important Note:** When using a `Process.sequential` workflow in CrewAI, the final task in the sequence **must be synchronous**. All other tasks can be asynchronous. This is a current limitation of the framework that FinWiz adheres to.
