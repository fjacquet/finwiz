integration_portfolio_task:
  description: >
    Analyze, integrate, and allocate investments across asset classes with a monthly budget of 1000 CHF.
    IMPORTANT: You must ONLY use the information provided in the stock_result, etf_result, and crypto_result inputs.
    DO NOT conduct any additional web searches or external research.
    
    Focus on:
    1. Analysis and Integration:
       a. FIRST check for JSON files (.json) for each crew's output, which contain structured data
          - Look for files like stock_unicorn_investment_recommendations.json, etc.
          - Use the JSONParserTool to extract structured data from these files
       b. If JSON is not available, fall back to parsing HTML content using HTMLParserTool
       c. Identify the strongest investment opportunities across all asset classes
       d. Evaluate the quality and consistency of recommendations
       e. Compare similar recommendations for consensus signals
       f. Highlight unique opportunities with strong potential
    2. Portfolio Allocation:
       a. Distribute the 1000 CHF across stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies
       b. Prioritize investments based on potential return
       c. Create appropriate diversification across asset classes
       d. Provide specific allocation amounts (in CHF) for each investment
    
    Today is {full_date}, it's day {current_day} of month {current_month} in year {current_year}.
    IMPORTANT: Ensure all recommendations reference real financial instruments with accurate ticker symbols.
    No hypothetical examples or "(Illustrative)" disclaimers. Allocation amounts must sum to exactly 1000 CHF.

    IMPORTANT: You must ONLY use the information provided in the previous task's output and the original
    stock_result, etf_result, and crypto_result inputs. DO NOT conduct any additional web searches
    or external research.
    
    Focus on:
    1. Data Consumption:
       a. PRIORITIZE using structured JSON data when available:
          - Use JSONParserTool to extract data from JSON files (like stock_unicorn_investment_recommendations.json)
          - This provides more accurate and complete information for your analysis
       b. Fall back to HTML parsing only when JSON data is not available
       c. Combine with the previous task's output for a complete picture
    
    2. Risk Assessment:
       a. Key risks specific to each asset class and individual investment based on the information provided
       b. Correlation risks within the portfolio
       c. Timing risks based on current market conditions mentioned in the crew reports
       d. Practical mitigation strategies for identified risks
    
    3. Final Report Creation:
       a. Synthesize all analyses into a coherent investment plan
       b. Present the strongest investment opportunities across asset classes
       c. Show the portfolio allocation with exact CHF amounts
       d. Provide clear implementation guidance
    
    IMPORTANT: Risk assessments must be evidence-based for each real financial instrument.
    Include only real financial instruments with accurate ticker symbols, implementable with 
    a 1000 CHF monthly budget. Information must be current as of {timestamp}.
