      - Key market trends
      - Technical analysis findings
      - Fundamental metrics
      - Risk assessments

      - Key metrics and findings
      - Source references

    4. **Cross-Asset Insights**: Look for patterns across different asset classes by querying the knowledge base about related assets.
